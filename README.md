# Database Management Systems Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes for my **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** engineering course.  
The notes are written in Markdown and structured by chapters to make studying, revision, and long-term reference easy and organized.

The goal of this repo is to provide a clear and concise summary of all core DBMS concepts as I study them throughout the semester.
